# Smart City Road Layout Design — Probability Flow (Detailed Explanation)

This version explains **why we are implementing each probability concept** in terms of the real goals (reducing traffic, lowering pollution, improving safety, etc.).

## 1. Implementing Poisson and Exponential Distributions → To Decrease Travel Times

Traffic delays mainly happen because vehicles arrive at junctions randomly. To reduce long waiting times and smoothen traffic flow:

* We **implement the Poisson distribution** to predict how many vehicles arrive in a specific time interval. This helps in planning road capacity and signal timings.

  Formula:

  $$
  P(N(t)=k) = \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}
  $$

* We **implement the Exponential distribution** to model how long vehicles wait at signals. This helps in designing signals that reduce average waiting time.

  Formula:

  $$
  f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}
  $$

**Why:** These models directly help us design layouts and signal timings that **decrease travel times and congestion**.

## 2. Implementing Normal Distribution → To Reduce Pollution

Pollution varies with traffic flow. To create road layouts that minimize emissions:

* We **implement the Normal distribution** to represent how pollution levels fluctuate around an average. This helps us predict when pollution is likely to be higher.

  Formula:

  $$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  $$

**Why:** Using this, we can identify layouts that maintain smoother traffic and therefore **reduce pollution caused by idling and congestion**.

## 3. Implementing Binomial Distribution → To Improve Safety

Accidents are uncertain but possible in traffic-heavy areas. To design safer layouts:

* We **implement the Binomial distribution** to model the probability of accidents happening over multiple days.

  Formula:

  $$
  P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
  $$

**Why:** This helps us compare layouts and choose the one that **reduces accident risk the most**.

---

## 4. Implementing Markov Chains → To Balance Traffic Across Routes

Drivers change routes based on traffic. To avoid overloading a single road:

* We **implement Markov Chains** to represent how drivers switch between roads depending on conditions.

  Formula:

  $$
  P_{ij} = P(\text{Next state} = j \mid \text{Current state} = i)
  $$

**Why:** This helps us design roads so that **traffic is distributed more evenly** instead of crowding one route.

---

## 5. Implementing Monte Carlo Simulation → To Compare Layouts Fairly

Since travel times, pollution, and accidents all involve randomness, one test is not enough.

* We **implement Monte Carlo Simulation** to run many experiments and average the results.

**Why:** This allows us to make **fair and reliable comparisons between different road designs**.

---

## Final Outcome

By implementing these probability concepts:

* Travel times are reduced.
* Pollution is lowered.
* Safety is improved.
* Traffic is balanced across routes.
* Layouts are tested fairly before real implementation.

**Conclusion:** We implement probability to achieve the final goal of a **better road layout with smooth traffic and less pollution** in a smart city.
