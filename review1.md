## Problem: Traffic Congestion in Cities

Traffic congestion is a common issue in cities. It results in three main problems:

1. Increased travel times
2. Higher pollution levels
3. Greater risk of accidents

We can use probability concepts to analyze and solve each of these issues.

## 1. Increased Travel Times → Poisson and Exponential Distributions

Traffic delays mainly happen because vehicles do not arrive at a junction in a fixed manner. Instead, they arrive randomly. To model this:

* The *Poisson distribution* is used to represent the number of vehicles arriving at a junction during a specific period of time. For example, if on average 5 cars arrive per minute, Poisson distribution helps us calculate the probability of exactly 3, 4, or 7 cars arriving in a given minute. This shows how traffic intensity can suddenly increase or decrease.

  Formula:

  $$
  P(N(t)=k) = \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}
  $$

* The *Exponential distribution* is used to represent the waiting time between vehicle arrivals or the time a vehicle spends waiting at a signal. For example, if the average waiting time is 2 minutes, exponential distribution can tell us the probability that a vehicle will wait less than or more than that time.

  Formula:

  $$
  f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}
  $$

*Why these concepts are better:* Together, Poisson and Exponential give a realistic picture of traffic. Poisson handles how many vehicles arrive, while Exponential handles how long they wait. This combination explains increased travel times more accurately than simple averages.

## 2. Higher Pollution Levels → Normal Distribution

Pollution in cities fluctuates depending on traffic volume, weather conditions, and fuel usage. It does not stay at one fixed value but usually varies around an average.

* The *Normal distribution* is used to model this natural variation. For example, if the average CO₂ level on a road is 50 ppm, sometimes it might be 45 ppm and sometimes 55 ppm. Normal distribution captures this variation in a bell-shaped curve.

  Formula:

  $$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  $$

*Why this concept is better:* Normal distribution is widely used in real-world measurements because most natural fluctuations follow this pattern. It gives us a clear way to estimate pollution levels around a mean value.

## 3. Greater Risk of Accidents → Binomial Distribution

Accidents are uncertain events — on any given day, an accident may or may not happen. To model this kind of event:

* The *Binomial distribution* is used. It deals with repeated trials where there are only two outcomes (accident or no accident). For example, if the probability of an accident on a road is 0.05 on a given day, binomial distribution helps calculate the probability of having exactly 2 accidents in 30 days.

  Formula:

  $$
  P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
  $$

*Why this concept is better:* Accidents are binary events (yes or no). Binomial distribution is the most natural and mathematically correct way to model such situations.

## 4. Uncertain Route Choices → Markov Chains

Drivers do not always pick the same road. They change routes based on traffic conditions. This behavior can be modeled using:

* *Markov Chains*, which describe probabilities of moving from one state (road) to another. For example, if 70% of drivers normally choose Road A and 30% choose Road B, but if Road A is congested the probability might shift to 50% and 50%.

  Formula:

  $$
  P_{ij} = P(\text{Next state} = j \mid \text{Current state} = i)
  $$

*Why this concept is better:* Markov Chains handle dynamic decisions over time, which makes them ideal for route-switching behavior.

## 5. Final Comparison → Monte Carlo Simulation

Since all these factors (arrivals, waiting times, accidents, pollution, and routes) are random, one single simulation is not enough. Results may change each time.

* *Monte Carlo Simulation* repeats the entire traffic model many times and calculates the average results. This ensures reliable predictions.

*Why this concept is better:* Monte Carlo reduces the effect of randomness by considering many possible scenarios, giving us realistic average outcomes.

---

## Final Outcome

By applying these probability models:

* We can predict travel times more accurately.
* We can estimate pollution with realistic variation.
* We can calculate accident risks.
* We can understand driver route choices.
* We can compare different road layouts with confidence.

*Conclusion:* Probability helps us design road layouts that reduce congestion, control pollution, and improve safety in smart cities.
